<p>For publishers who got started with monetization by utilizing Google AdSense as their self-serve advertising platform, the time often comes when site growth and/or direct advertising opportunities prompt a desire for more features, greater flexibility and control, or just more revenue. When any of these feelings start cropping up, it’s time to consider upgrading to Google Ad Manager.</p>
<p>Why Use Google Ad Manager?</p>
<p>AdSense is a great product and it provides a convenient, profitable service to tens of thousands of publishers. But AdSense requires publishers to make a tradeoff — give up the potential to earn more from advertising in exchange for automated ad services and virtually no ad ops man hours. For many publishers, the need for more advertising capabilities arises when advertisers begin to approach the site to inquire about buying advertising directly. In other cases, the site simply reaches a place where it can increase profits and has enough staff to give some time to ad revenue management. In either of these situations, Google Ad Manager (GAM) is the next logical step. But that doesn’t mean you have to give up AdSense. In fact, AdSense works great with whatever blend of options you use on GAM (more on that below).</p>
<p>As an ad network management platform, GAM offers publishers many opportunities to control their own ad inventory, from header bidding to ad network management to direct sales. This allows the publisher the chance to sell their ad space directly to advertisers or to connect with any number of programmatic providers. Managing a variety of ad demand with GAM is its own series of blog posts, so we’re going to focus on the first and most important step: getting signed up and set up correctly.</p>
<p>How to Setup Google Ad Manager</p>
<p>The step-by-step process below will help publishers who are already using AdSense to activate a GAM account and connect their existing AdSense account, preserving all existing and historical data and account info. Steps 2 and 4, in particular, are focused on connecting AdSense with the new GAM account. You’ll note that in the following four steps, we link to numerous Google support pages. This is necessary because even though Google provides very comprehensive individual support pages, it can still be very confusing trying to navigate them all in order to set up your GAM account and link an existing AdSense account.</p>
<p>Step 1: Sign up for a Google Ad Manager account
Click here to sign up for a Google Ad Manager account. Find more information at Google’s own support page for GAM signups here: Sign up for a Google Ad Manager account</p>
<p>Step 2: Link your existing AdSense account to your new GAM account
Follow these instructions to link your AdSense (and AdX, if you have it) account to your GAM account (see the original instructions from Google here):</p>
